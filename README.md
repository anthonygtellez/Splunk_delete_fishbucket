# Splunk_delete_fishbucket
This app can be used to remotely delete the fishbucket on a deploymentclient for reindexing data stored locally on the target device.
Deploy the windows version only on windows clients, deploy the linux version only on linux hosts. 

#####I am not repsonsible for any damages, lost data caused to target systems due to abuse or misunderstanding. The software as is and I take no responsbility for what you (the user) do with it. Use carefully, and wisely. The app is designed to be deployed only once, modifying the source code to run more than once will likely result in tears. :'(
